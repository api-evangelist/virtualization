  name: API descriptions
  summary: ""
  abstract: API description techniques are described for consumption by dynamically-typed
    languages. In one or more implementations, machine-readable data is parsed to
    locate descriptions of one or more application programming interfaces (APIs).
    The descriptions of the one or more application programming interfaces are projected
    into an alternate form that is different than a form of the machine-readable data.

  name: Generating XML schema from JSON data
  summary: ""
  abstract: A computer receives a first JSON data that includes at least one JSON
    array or JSON object value. The computer parses a stream of JSON data, wherein
    the stream of JSON data includes at least a part of the first JSON data. The computer
    determines the logical structure of the first JSON data using the parsed stream
    of JSON data. The computer generates an XML schema based on the logical structure
    of the first JSON data.

  name: Systems and methods for generating schemas that represent multiple data sources
  summary: ""
  abstract: Systems and methods generating schemas that represent multiple data sources
    are provided herein. According to some embodiments, methods may include determining
    a schema for each of the multiple data sources via a computing device communicatively
    couplable with each of the multiple data sources, each of the multiple data sources
    including one or more data structures that define how data is stored in the data
    source, generating a negotiated schema by comparing the schemas of the multiple
    data sources to one another and interrelating data points of the multiple data
    sources based upon the schemas, interrelating the negotiated schema with the schema
    for each of the multiple data sources based upon the interrelation of the data
    points, and storing the negotiated schema in a storage media by way of the computing
    device.

  name: Process for serializing and deserializing data described by a schema
  summary: ""
  abstract: A process for serializing and deserializing instance data from a schema
    is disclosed. A schema can be used to automatically and dynamically generate classes
    and methods. First, the raw schema may be parsed into an intermediate data structure
    consisting of <key,value> pairs representing object properties and attributes
    of the properties. Then, an exemplary process generates new parser classes and
    methods by iterating over the intermediate data structure's keys and generating
    classes or class variables based on the property type. Accessors and mutators
    are generated for each class variable. Additionally, a serialization method and
    a constructor method are generated for each class. These classes and methods are
    stored in memory and can be used by a host programming language to transmit, receive,
    and manipulate data to or from an API.

  name: Algorithm for updating XML schema registry using schema pass by value with
    message
  summary: ""
  abstract: Schema information is provided with transmission of a data object. When
    a data object is converted to a transmission format, schema information for the
    object type is added to the transmission format element. The unmarshalling code
    uses the schema information to update a schema registry at the receiving end.
    The schema registry may then be used as a tool for converting the transmission
    format element back to the data element. The next time an object of that object
    type is sent to the recipient, the schema information is not added to the transmission
    format element.
