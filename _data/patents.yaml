  name: Generating virtualized application programming interface (API) implementation
    from narrative API documentation
  summary: ""
  abstract: A virtualized Application Program Interface (API) implementation is generated
    based upon narrative API documentation that includes sentences that describe the
    API, by generating programming statements for the virtualized API implementation
    based upon parsing the narrative API documentation, and generating the virtualized
    API implementation based on upon the programming statements for the virtualized
    API implementation. The parsing of the narrative documentation may use a natural
    language parser and a domain-specific ontology for the API that may be obtained
    or created for the API. The virtualized API implementation may be generated using
    an API virtualizer.

  name: Client bandwidth emulation in hosted services
  summary: ""
  abstract: Bandwidth on the Internet and intranets is highly variable and unreliable,
    two properties that can make streaming digital media content difficult. In a virtualization
    system (e.g., virtual desktop, remote desktop, remote application, and the like),
    this is especially so based on different bandwidths available to the session host
    and the session client. Methods and systems for emulating a bandwidth of a client
    device in a virtualization system are described. When the session host is executing
    an application (e.g., a digital media application), the session host may emulate
    the bandwidth of the session client by hooking into and throttling data over one
    or more APIs associated with the digital media application, thereby tricking the
    application into making a bandwidth determination based on the emulated bandwidth
    of the session client, rather than based on the bandwidth of the session host.
