  name: Apache Avro
  summary: Apache Avro is a data serialization system. Avro relies on schemas. When
    Avro data is read, the schema used when writing it is always present. This permits
    each datum to be written with no per-value overheads, making serialization both
    fast and small. This also facilitates use with dynamic, scripting languages, since
    data, together with its schema, is fully self-describing.

  summary: "API Blueprint is a documentation-oriented API description language. A
    couple of semantic assumptions over the plain Markdown. API Blueprint is perfect
    for designing your Web API and its comprehensive documentation but also for quick
    prototyping and collaboration. It is easy to learn and even easier to read \u2013
    after all it is just a form of plain text."

    JSON-based API that exposes machine-readable metadata about Google APIs, but could
    also be used to describe other APIs.
